# Spam Classification using Natural Language Processing
 
●	Programmed and streamlined a Python based application which helps us identify between a spam and a normal message.

●	The SMS/Email Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS/Email Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,567 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.

●	Evaluated TF-IDF for feature extraction of the text data for the messages. Remodeled using splits for skewed data (Since the number of ham are far more than the number of spam messages, the data is skewed)

●	Applied stratified shuffled split for the split of skewed data. Different standard classifiers for classification of the SMS were used and then compared the accuracy of various classifiers using standard classification metrics
